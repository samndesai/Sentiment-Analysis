# Sentiment-Analysis

●The goal of our project is to apply machine learning for sentiment analysis or
opinion mining on user generated comments of our subset(subreddit).

● We are looking to classify comments as being positive or negative.

● An opinion is defined as a positive or negative sentiment, view, attitude,
emotion or appraisal about an entity or an aspect of the entity from an opinion
holder.
